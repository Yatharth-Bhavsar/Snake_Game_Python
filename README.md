# 🐍 Snake Game

## 📝 Project Overview

This project is a classic implementation of the Snake Game using Python's `pygame` library. The objective of the game is to navigate the snake around the screen, eat the food to grow longer, and avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. The game gets progressively more challenging as the snake grows longer.

## 🚀 Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**:
  - Navigate the snake using arrow keys.
  - Eat food to grow longer.
  - Avoid collisions with walls and the snake's own body.

- **Scoring System**:
  - Players earn points based on the number of food items consumed.
  - The score is displayed on the screen during gameplay.

- **Game Over Condition**:
  - The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own body.
  - The final score is displayed upon game over.

## 💻 Requirements

- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🎮 `pygame` library
